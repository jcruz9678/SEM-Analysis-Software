# SEM-Analysis-Software
The program takes an image and applies edge detection. The edges are then used to calculate period, width, height, and duty cycle. An image is provided.

The Software uses an implimentation of the Canny Edge Detection that is not my own. This was created for a comapny I previously worked at and was given permission to post the code on my own Git. The code will not compile, but is used to demonstrate some of the pervious work I have completed. The software takes an image taken by a Scanning Electron Microscope which is chosen by the user through the GUI. The image then undergoes edge detection and those edges are used to determine key points that are stored and used to calculate height, width, period and duty cycle of the image.
