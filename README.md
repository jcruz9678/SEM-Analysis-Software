# SEM-Analysis-Software
The program takes an image and applies edge detection. The edges are then used to calculate period, width, height, and duty cycle. An image is provided.

The Software uses an implimentation of the Canny Edge Detection that is not my own. This was created for a comapny ipreviously worked at and was given permission to post the code on my wn Git. The code will not compile, but is used to demonstrate some of the pervious work I have completed.
